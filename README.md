# Basic Blog
Hi 游녦,

In this project, I will create a simple blog site. <br>
I believe it will be a great project to learn and practice PHP and SQL.

游꿢 My goals will be as follows;

<pre>
游릭 Login Screen
		游릭 Registration (first commit's login = admin, 123456)
				游댖 Database Connection
				游댖 Authorization (SuperAdmin, Editor etc.)

游릭 Home Page
		游댖 Menu Bar
		游릭 Safe Exit
		
游댖 Users
		游댖 Database Connection
		游댖 Authorization (SuperAdmin)
		游댖 Administration Controls (User Add, Delete, Update)

游댖 Blogs
  </pre>
  
Currently, I am writing the variables and texts in the code in Turkish, <br>
which is my native language, but I plan to translate them <br>
into English at the end of the project. <br>
